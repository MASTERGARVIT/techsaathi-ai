# Requirements Specification – TechSaathi

## 1. Problem Definition

People across Bharat face difficulties in learning and applying technology due to
complex documentation, English-centric explanations, and lack of step-by-step,
contextual guidance. This results in slower learning, lower productivity, and reduced
participation in the digital economy.

## 2. Target Users

### Primary Users
- Students learning technology for the first time
- Early-career developers
- Non-technical founders and professionals

### Secondary Users
- Educators and mentors
- Skill development programs

## 3. User Needs

- Simple explanations of technical concepts
- Ability to understand unfamiliar code and documents
- Clear next steps after explanations
- Learning paths aligned with personal goals
- Low-bandwidth and mobile-friendly access

## 4. Core Features

1. Role-based onboarding (Student / Developer / Non-technical)
2. Question answering with simplified explanations
3. Code and document upload with AI-based explanation
4. Step-by-step actionable guidance
5. Context-aware responses based on user skill level

## 5. Functional Requirements

- The system shall allow users to select their role
- The system shall accept text queries and file uploads
- The system shall analyze user input and context
- The system shall generate simplified explanations
- The system shall provide step-by-step guidance

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- High availability
- Low response latency
- Scalable architecture
- Secure handling of uploaded files

## 7. Why AI Is Needed

Traditional rule-based systems cannot:
- Adapt explanations to different skill levels
- Simplify complex code dynamically
